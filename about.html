          <h3>How we came to be</h3>
          <h4>Marley realizied arounf the time that he came up with the idea of the bussiness that his brother really didnt understand how to take care of his hair despite him having nice long dreads. It always bothered him that only a week after getting a retwist that his brother's hair would be messed up. It hit him that not everyone understood their hair and how to take care of it "I realized that not everyone has that quick access to getting their hair done so I decided to do something about it" </h4>
